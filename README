Game of Life
Simulation of John Conwayâ€™s Game of Life written in C++.
It is a cellular automation program that runs through an algorithm to test whether
a cell will die, survive, or become alive based on the number of neighbors it has.
If the cell is dead and it has exactly 3 neighbors, it becomes alive.
If the cell is alive and has less then 2 neighbors, it dies due to under population.
If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, it lives.
If the cell is alive and has more then 3 neighbors, it dies due to overpopulation.
Dead cells are represented by a '.'
Alive cells are represented by a '*'

Getting Started
Run the main.cpp along with the Game_Of_Life.cpp and Game_Of_Life.h files to run the program.
You will be prompted to insert a .txt file.
Example .txt files of an exploder and a glider are included with the repository.
If you would like to make your own cell map, it needs to be a square, that is, it needs
to have the same amount of rows as columns. It can be as big as you want, however, bigger maps
may not run as fast.

You will be asked if you want to automate the process.
This means that the program will run automatically and display the map
every second. To quit, hit CTRL-C.
If you do not automate it, you will be asked every time the map prints if you would like to continue.
Inputting 'n' will quit the program.
